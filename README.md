After reviewing the different data science predictive modeling techniques, it was decided that Random Forest would be the best model for a retail setting. This model works by randomly sampling a large amount of data and splitting it up. The model then creates a bunch of decision trees which are trained on their own individual subsets of data and then make their own predictions. Once all of the trees have been trained they are all combined to make a final prediction by using a majority “vote” from the trees. Random forests are good for predicting which retail categories are growing or shrinking in customer engagement because it can identify the features that are the most impacted by engagement. It can also identify relationships between departmental features and sales because this model is nonlinear and can pick up on relationships some other models would miss. These reasons could also be applied to the questions of demographics and sales, as the ability to make these nonlinear relationships allow the model to make accurate predictions for customer sales and generate beneficial recommendations.
